  In Tezos bakers vote on the behalf of their delegators. Each proposal takes a
  few months to work through a step of voting & testing thresholds. At a $XTZ
  holder you must make sure your baker votes.

# Follow Tezos governance \(wip\)

## TL;DR - The only way to make distributed consensus work well is by getting involved personally \(yes, you\). Talk to your baker! Ask them how they voted on the current or past proposal and why. Does their vote represent your interest? Lastly, exchanges don't vote, you're throwing your vote away. Number go up make world better place?

## What is the Tezos governance process?

The entire Tezos governance process and subsequent node update are fully on-chain and automated. The voting rules are known ahead of time. Bakers cast votes during the **Proposal Period**, the **Exploration Vote Period** and the **Propotion Vote Period** on the behalf of their delegators \(_note: in a not too distant update, delegators will have the option to overriding their baker's vote for their stake_\)
