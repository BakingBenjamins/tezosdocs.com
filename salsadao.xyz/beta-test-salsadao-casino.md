# Beta Test SalsaDAO Casino

{% hint style="info" %}
For the purposes of this guide, we are using the Temple wallet [https://templewallet.com/](https://templewallet.com/)

This is just a browser extension which can be installed on a number of browsers & can be used with your Ledger Nano wallets for extra peace of mind.
{% endhint %}

## Generate and import testnet faucet funds

Go to [**https://faucet.tzalpha.net/**](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/) and generate a faucet file and download it to your desktop

![Tezos faucet file](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

Within **Temple wallet** click on the account icon at the top right \(picture below\) and select **import**, followed by the **Faucet File** option

![Import Account](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

Either paste the contents or upload the file

![Faucet File](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)

After importing you should see a success message and it will take 1 minute to confirm

After finishing the import you should have a new shiny test account on the **Florencenet** network

## Setup SalsaDAO Beta Environment

Navigate to [https://beta.salsadao.xyz ](https://beta.salsadao.xyz%20)

Make sure you still have your test account selected on the **Florencenet** network \(picture above\) before proceeding

**First**, click Get free test token, confirm the transaction and wait 60-90 seconds before proceeding with the next step.

If you don't like the default explorer, use [https://florencenet.tzkt.io/](https://florencenet.tzkt.io/)
{% endhint %}

**Second**, grant Casino permissions, and again wait until the transaction is confirmed.
